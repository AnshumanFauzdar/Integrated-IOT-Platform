# Integrated IOT Platform

Introducing new and best form of Integrated IOT Platform for your IOT devices and any other stuff which uses internet connectivity with your device

PS- Project is in development phase and still lacks any name and codes!

# Basic Idea

When you come with an idea of controlling your device/hobby projects with internet or try to give wirless conectivity you have to struglle between many things which includes basic interface btw your project and controller, and moreover giving a trigger to action and implementing automation to project is not simple enough and requires many services to work on!

*So, what is present technology to work upon?*

Ummmm, for basic projects which inlclude a beautiful interface and simplicity is "**Blynk**" which allows you to flash code and then work with your Wifi and internet connectivity

Then next comes services which consists of triggers and feeds which help to store data and give further information according to project need which serves as triggers, here **Adafruit IO** comes in game which have simplified interface for dashboard, feeds and triggers which allows you to render according to your needs but here is one problem! this have limited access for free which includes 10 feeds only!!

What your IOT project needs the most is automation, like when you want your projects to work upon independtly and take action which is extremly simplified by "**IFTTT**" which allows you to make controls and commands according to your automated work!

# So whats different with this project?

Basic idea for this project is intergrating all three solutions in one place which includes Device control(Blynk), Triggers and feeds(Adafruit IO) and automation(IFTTT) so that all your IOT work is in one place and simplified for future updates!

**//STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE - Stay Tuned//**
